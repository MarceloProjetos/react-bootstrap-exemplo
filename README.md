How to creat one react + react-bootstrap + lodash and library in one clean aplication with creat-react-app

#Structure of Project
![alt tag](https://github.com/MarceloProjetos/react-bootstrap-exemplo/blob/master/images/estrutura.png)

This project is an React page that accesses a "MQTT" server, that accesses the "Node-red". The Node-Red in turn accesses a MongoDB database which stores the records.

# Install environment

### To setup this project we need to the free softwares below:

| Software | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Java SE][6]  |If you have not installed, First download and install the most suitable for your system. X64 or i586. |
| [ActiveMQ][2] | MQTT v3.1 support allowing for connections in an IoT environment.  |
| [NodeJS][3]   | Support package npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. |
| [Node-Red][1] | Node-RED is a tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services. |
| [MongoDB][5]  | It is a graphical tool for control together hardware devices, online services and others NPM library. |

## 1-Installation NODE-JS and Python

Access the site [NodeJS][3]

Download the latest LTS version, follow with the default installation. In this example I used the "node-v6.9.1-x64"

Now install the **phyton**. In this tutorial I used [python-2.7.10][8]

Wait for the installation and restart the machine to continue.

## 2- Create-react-app installation  

Install it once globally:
```
  -npm install -g create-react-app
```
### Creating an App

To create a new app, run:
```
create-react-app react-bootstrap-exemplo && cd react-bootstrap-exemplo
npm start
```
Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>
When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

## 3- Adding Bootstrap

Install React Bootstrap and Bootstrap from NPM. React Bootstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:

```
npm install react-bootstrap --save
npm install bootstrap@3 --save
npm install react-bootstrap-date-picker --save
```

Import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the ```src/index.js``` file:

```js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css';
```

Import required React Bootstrap components within ```src/App.js``` file or your custom component files:

```js
import { Navbar, Jumbotron, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';
```
Now you are ready to use the imported React Bootstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method.

## 4- Adding mqtt, lodash and node-uuid

MQTT.js is a client library for the [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) protocol, written
in JavaScript for node.js and the browser.
```
npm install mqtt --save
```
Node-uuid simple, fast generation of [RFC4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUIDS.
```
npm install node-uuid --save
```
Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays,
numbers, objects, strings, etc.
```
npm install lodash --save
```
## 5-Broker Installation "ActiveMQ" 

Access the site [ActiveMQ][2]
Look for "Downloads" and download the version **"Windows Distribution"**

Unzip the file "apache-activemq-5.14.1-bin.zip" 
In a terminal window enter the following command

    .../apache-activemq-5.14.1/bin/activemq start

If an error occurred, Maybe you don't have installed "JAVA SE". Download and install the [**"Java SE Development Kit"**][6].

For test open a browser **FireFox** or **Chrome** e connect to port 8161 "http://127.0.0.1:8161/admin/"

Password: **admin**   Login: **admin**

Configuring to start ActiveMQ on Windows Boot.

For systems 64 bits in a terminal window, in root permission, enter the following command

    .../apache-activemq-5.13.3/bin/win64/InstallService.bat

For systems 32 bits in a terminal window, in root permission, enter the following command

    .../apache-activemq-5.13.3/bin/win32/InstallService.bat

To verify that it is installed as a service see:

    Control Panel-->Administrative tools-->Services and look for **ActiveMQ**
    
----

## 5-Node-red

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

    npm install -g node-red
    npm install -g bcryptjs

Wait finish installation...

Run the following command in root mode. Of the libraries installation.

    npm install -g node-red-node-mongodb

Run the command prompt **"node-red"**

Open <http://localhost:1880>

To restore a node-red flow with Ctrl-I command or the menu, "Menu > Import > Clipboard".

Below you will find node-red project.

```
Select all **"Ctrl-a"** --> Copy **"Ctrl-c"** --> Past **"Ctrl-v"** all JSON content to the box that appears empty in node-red.

Click "OK" and position the flow where to find, the better.

Check out http://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/ for full instructions on getting started.

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.

##5-Configuring access of node-red across settings.js

**DNS**
There are two ways to access a page on the Internet: the domain name "DNS" or "IP ADDRESS" of the servers on which it is hosted. In our case "Node-RED."

For your application to make a simple DNS access or "IP ADDRESS". We need to edit the [settings.js][9] file.

    user folder...\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\node-red\settings.js
or 

    user folder...\.node-red\settings.js

The first thing that changed is the node-red port. Change 8080 to 80 as below:

    uiPort: process.env.PORT || 80,
    
The second change was uncomment the line 

    httpAdminRoot: '/admin',
    
Now save the "settings.js" and restart **node-red**
    
With this change your page application its goes::

    http://127.0.0.1:80
    
And now to access your **node-red flow** enter in:

    http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/

And now it is easy to configure your DNS server, for directly access your application. And remember now to access your flow is "IP/admin"!

Now you can create an ALIAS on your DNS server for the IP Project.

| NAME          |   TYPE        |   TARGET      |
| --------      | -----------   |-----------    |
| example.com   |      A        | 192.168.0.X   |

___
##6- PASSWORD in node-red flow

To protect your **node-red flow**, you can enable password. 

The first thing enter the **node_modules** directory:

    ....\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules

You need to make a key with this commnand and put your **password**:

    node -e "console.log(require('bcryptjs').hashSync(process.argv[1], 8));" your-password-here

Now save result number and edit the file settings.js again.

    //},

    // If you need to set an http proxy please set an environment variable
    // called http_proxy (or HTTP_PROXY) outside of Node-RED in the operating system.
    // For example - http_proxy=http://myproxy.com:8080
    // (Setting it here will have no effect)

    //   next();
    //},

    // Anything in this hash is globally available to all functions.
    // It is accessed as context.global.

Find and uncomment the lines as bellow and place the generated password on the line.

    adminAuth: {
        type: "credentials",
        users: [{
           username: "admin",
            password: "your generated password",
            permissions: "*"
        }]
    },

Now save the "settings.js" and restart **node-red**

## 6-Installation MongoDB

Access the site [MongoDB][5]
Download file mongodb-win32-x86_64-2008plus-ssl-3.2.9-signed.msi or later version.
Run the default full installation.

Once installed MongoDB Create 3 directories to store the data.

    mkdir c:\data
    mkdir c:\data\db
    mkdir c:\data\log
        
In c:\data create one file named "mongod.cfg" containing:

    systemLog:
    destination: file
    path: c:\data\log\mongod.log
    storage:
    dbPath: c:\data\db

Save and close file...

Starting Server MongoDB "**mongod**"

Enter the directory where is installed the binaries and run the command. 

In my case it is ...

    c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin>mongod -dbpath c:\data\db

If your system is Windows 32bits

    C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin>mongod --journal --storageEngine=mmapv1 -dbpath c:\data\db
    
If the Windows firewall ask for permission, click the button to "Allow Access".

Now open another Windows Prompt or "Powershell"

To make a connection to MongoDB server that left running in the previous step.

Enter the directory where you installed the binaries again and run:

    c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin\mongo.exe

You will see the prompt mongodb, ready to receive your commands!
___
###Testing and creating Collections or Tables

Enter at the prompt where you run "mongo.exe" run commands below:

    use db 					            <--Create a database called db. If exists it enters in the collection.
    db.createCollection('parametros')	<--Create a collection called parametros
    db.createCollection('log_erro')		<--Create a collection called log_erro
    db.createCollection('indice')		<--Create a collection called indice
    show dbs 				            <--Show names of banks and their sizes
    show collections			        <--Displays the collections in the current bank
    exit					            <--Exit to mongo shell or **Ctrl + C**

Installing the service for MongoDB automatically start on Windows **boot**.

Enter the directory where is installed the binaries and run the command.

    c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin\mongod --config "c:\data\mongod.cfg" --install
    
If your system is Windows 32bits

    c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin\mongod --journal --config "c:\data\mongod.cfg" --install
    
I use as webadmin the "**mongobooster**"
