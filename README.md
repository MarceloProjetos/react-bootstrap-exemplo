=======================

How to creat one react + react-bootstrap + lodash and library in one clean aplication with creat-react-app

#Structure of Project
![alt tag](https://github.com/MarceloProjetos/react-bootstrap-exemplo/blob/master/images/estrutura.png)

This project is an React page that accesses a "MQTT" server, that accesses the "Node-red". The Node-Red in turn accesses a MongoDB database which stores the records.

# Install environment

### To setup this project we need to the free softwares below:

| Software | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Java SE][6]  |If you have not installed, First download and install the most suitable for your system. X64 or i586. |
| [ActiveMQ][2] | MQTT v3.1 support allowing for connections in an IoT environment.  |
| [NodeJS][3]   | Support package npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. |
| [Node-Red][1] | Node-RED is a tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services. |
| [MongoDB][5]  | It is a graphical tool for control together hardware devices, online services and others NPM library. |

## 1-Installation NODE-JS and Python

Access the site [NodeJS][3]

Download the latest LTS version, follow with the default installation. In this example I used the "node-v6.9.1-x64"

Now install the **phyton**. In this tutorial I used [python-2.7.10][8]

Wait for the installation and restart the machine to continue.

## 2- Create-react-app installation  

Install it once globally:
```
  -npm install -g create-react-app
```
### Creating an App

To create a new app, run:
```
create-react-app react-bootstrap-exemplo && cd react-bootstrap-exemplo
npm start
```
Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>
When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

## 3- Adding Bootstrap

Install React Bootstrap and Bootstrap from NPM. React Bootstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:

```
npm install react-bootstrap --save
npm install bootstrap@3 --save
npm install react-bootstrap-date-picker --save
```

Import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the ```src/index.js``` file:

```js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css';
```

Import required React Bootstrap components within ```src/App.js``` file or your custom component files:

```js
import { Navbar, Jumbotron, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';
```
Now you are ready to use the imported React Bootstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method.

## 4- Adding mqtt, lodash and node-uuid

MQTT.js is a client library for the [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) protocol, written
in JavaScript for node.js and the browser.
```
npm install mqtt --save
```
Node-uuid simple, fast generation of [RFC4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUIDS.
```
npm install node-uuid --save
```
Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays,
numbers, objects, strings, etc.
```
npm install lodash --save
```
## 5-Broker Installation "ActiveMQ" 

Access the site [ActiveMQ][2]
Look for "Downloads" and download the version **"Windows Distribution"**

Unzip the file "apache-activemq-5.14.1-bin.zip" 
In a terminal window enter the following command

    .../apache-activemq-5.14.1/bin/activemq start

If an error occurred, Maybe you don't have installed "JAVA SE". Download and install the [**"Java SE Development Kit"**][6].

For test open a browser **FireFox** or **Chrome** e connect to port 8161 "http://127.0.0.1:8161/admin/"

Password: **admin**   Login: **admin**

Configuring to start ActiveMQ on Windows Boot.

For systems 64 bits in a terminal window, in root permission, enter the following command

    .../apache-activemq-5.13.3/bin/win64/InstallService.bat

For systems 32 bits in a terminal window, in root permission, enter the following command

    .../apache-activemq-5.13.3/bin/win32/InstallService.bat

To verify that it is installed as a service see:

    Control Panel-->Administrative tools-->Services and look for **ActiveMQ**
   
**Delete all of the topics in ActiveMQ on startup:**

Go to configuration file "ACTIVEMQ.XML", open the file for editing on the broker element, add the following attribute: 

    deleteAllMessagesOnStartup="true"
   
This will cause all previous topics & queues, and their pending messages to be deleted from your kaha store when you restart your broker.

In my case...

    <broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core" brokerName="localhost" dataDirectory="${activemq.data}"  deleteAllMessagesOnStartup="true">

----

## 5-Node-red

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

    npm install -g node-red
    npm install -g bcryptjs

Wait finish installation...

Run the following command in root mode. Of the libraries installation.

    npm install -g node-red-node-mongodb

Run the command prompt **"node-red"**

Open <http://localhost:1880>

To restore a node-red flow with Ctrl-I command or the menu, "Menu > Import > Clipboard".

Below you will find node-red project.

Select all **"Ctrl-a"** --> Copy **"Ctrl-c"** --> Past **"Ctrl-v"** all JSON content to the box that appears empty in node-red.

Click "OK" and position the flow where to find, the better.

Check out http://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/ for full instructions on getting started.

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.

##5-Configuring access of node-red across settings.js

**DNS**
There are two ways to access a page on the Internet: the domain name "DNS" or "IP ADDRESS" of the servers on which it is hosted. In our case "Node-RED."

For your application to make a simple DNS access or "IP ADDRESS". We need to edit the [settings.js][9] file.

    user folder...\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\node-red\settings.js
or 

    user folder...\.node-red\settings.js

The first thing that changed is the node-red port. Change 8080 to 80 as below:

    uiPort: process.env.PORT || 80,
    
The second change was uncomment the line 

    httpAdminRoot: '/admin',
    
Now save the "settings.js" and restart **node-red**
    
With this change your page application its goes::

    http://127.0.0.1:80
    
And now to access your **node-red flow** enter in:

    http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/

And now it is easy to configure your DNS server, for directly access your application. And remember now to access your flow is "IP/admin"!

Now you can create an ALIAS on your DNS server for the IP Project.

| NAME          |   TYPE        |   TARGET      |
| --------      | -----------   |-----------    |
| example.com   |      A        | 192.168.0.X   |

___
##6- PASSWORD in node-red flow

To protect your **node-red flow**, you can enable password. 

The first thing enter the **node_modules** directory:

    ....\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules

You need to make a key with this commnand and put your **password**:

    node -e "console.log(require('bcryptjs').hashSync(process.argv[1], 8));" your-password-here

Now save result number and edit the file settings.js again.

    // Node-RED scans the `nodes` directory in the install directory to find nodes.
    // The following property can be used to specify an additional directory to scan.
    //nodesDir: '/home/nol/.node-red/nodes',

    // By default, the Node-RED UI is available at http://localhost:1880/
    // The following property can be used to specifiy a different root path.
    // If set to false, this is disabled.
    httpAdminRoot: '/admin',

    // Some nodes, such as HTTP In, can be used to listen for incoming http requests.
    // By default, these are served relative to '/'. The following property
    // can be used to specifiy a different root path. If set to false, this is
    // disabled.
    //httpNodeRoot: '/red-nodes',

    // The following property can be used in place of 'httpAdminRoot' and 'httpNodeRoot',
    // to apply the same root to both parts.
    //httpRoot: '/red',

    // When httpAdminRoot is used to move the UI to a different root path, the
    // following property can be used to identify a directory of static content

    // Securing Node-RED
    // -----------------
    // To password protect the Node-RED editor and admin API, the following
    // property can be used. See http://nodered.org/docs/security.html for details.
    adminAuth: {
        type: "credentials",
        users: [{
           username: "admin",
            password: "$2a$08$tIP24A6fn9F9DH30OwunG.4dWSO7sJk/YvbabyvKY1ej9DN0GrCLe",
            permissions: "*"
        }]
    },

    // To password protect the node-defined HTTP endpoints (httpNodeRoot), or 
    // the static content (httpStatic), the following properties can be used.
    // The pass field is a bcrypt hash of the password.
    // See http://nodered.org/docs/security.html#generating-the-password-hash
    //httpNodeAuth: {user:"user",pass:"$2a$08$zZWtXTja0fB1pzD4sHCMyOCMYz2Z6dNbM6tl8sJogENOMcxWV9DN."},
    //httpStaticAuth: {user:"user",pass:"$2a$08$zZWtXTja0fB1pzD4sHCMyOCMYz2Z6dNbM6tl8sJogENOMcxWV9DN."},

    // The following property can be used to enable HTTPS
    // See http://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_createserver_options_requestlistener
    // for details on its contents.
    // See the comment at the top of this file on how to load the `fs` module used by
    // this setting.
    //
    //https: {
    //    key: fs.readFileSync('privatekey.pem'),
    //    cert: fs.readFileSync('certificate.pem')
    //},

    // The following property can be used to disable the editor. The admin API
    // is not affected by this option. To disable both the editor and the admin
    // API, use either the httpRoot or httpAdminRoot properties
    //disableEditor: false,

    // The following property can be used to configure cross-origin resource sharing
    // in the HTTP nodes.
    // See https://github.com/troygoode/node-cors#configuration-options for
    // details on its contents. The following is a basic permissive set of options:
    //httpNodeCors: {
    //    origin: "*",
    //    methods: "GET,PUT,POST,DELETE"
    //},

    // If you need to set an http proxy please set an environment variable
    // called http_proxy (or HTTP_PROXY) outside of Node-RED in the operating system.
    // For example - http_proxy=http://myproxy.com:8080
    // (Setting it here will have no effect)
    // You may also specify no_proxy (or NO_PROXY) to supply a comma separated
    // list of domains to not proxy, eg - no_proxy=.acme.co,.acme.co.uk

    // The following property can be used to add a custom middleware function
    // in front of all http in nodes. This allows custom authentication to be
    // applied to all http in nodes, or any other sort of common request processing.
    //httpNodeMiddleware: function(req,res,next) {
    //   // Handle/reject the request, or pass it on to the http in node
    //   // by calling next();
    //   next();
    //},

    // Anything in this hash is globally available to all functions.
    // It is accessed as context.global.
    // eg:
    //    functionGlobalContext: { os:require('os') }
    // can be accessed in a function block as:
    //    context.global.os

    functionGlobalContext: {
        // os:require('os'),
        // octalbonescript:require('octalbonescript'),
        // jfive:require("johnny-five"),
        // j5board:require("johnny-five").Board({repl:false})
    },

    // The following property can be used to order the categories in the editor
    // palette. If a node's category is not in the list, the category will get
    // added to the end of the palette.
    // If not set, the following default order is used:
    //paletteCategories: ['subflows', 'input', 'output', 'function', 'social', 'mobile', 'storage', 'analysis', 'advanced'],

    // Configure the logging output
    logging: {
        // Only console logging is currently supported
        console: {
            // Level of logging to be recorded. Options are:
            // fatal - only those errors which make the application unusable should be recorded
            // error - record errors which are deemed fatal for a particular request + fatal errors
            // warn - record problems which are non fatal + errors + fatal errors
            // info - record information about the general running of the application + warn + error + fatal errors
            // debug - record information which is more verbose than info + info + warn + error + fatal errors
            // trace - record very detailed logging + debug + info + warn + error + fatal errors
            level: "info",
            // Whether or not to include metric events in the log output
            metrics: false,
            // Whether or not to include audit events in the log output
            audit: false
        }
    }
}
 ```

Find and uncomment the lines as bellow and place the generated password on the line.

    adminAuth: {
        type: "credentials",
        users: [{
           username: "admin",
            password: "your generated password",
            permissions: "*"
        }]
    },

Now save the "settings.js" and restart **node-red**

When you come back to:

    http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/

## 6-Installation MongoDB

Access the site [MongoDB][5]
Download file mongodb-win32-x86_64-2008plus-ssl-3.2.9-signed.msi or later version.
Run the default full installation.

Once installed MongoDB Create 3 directories to store the data.

    mkdir c:\data
    mkdir c:\data\db
    mkdir c:\data\log
        
In c:\data create one file named "mongod.cfg" containing:

    systemLog:
    destination: file
    path: c:\data\log\mongod.log
    storage:
    dbPath: c:\data\db

Save and close file...

Starting Server MongoDB "**mongod**"

Enter the directory where is installed the binaries and run the command. 

In my case it is ...

    c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin>mongod -dbpath c:\data\db

If your system is Windows 32bits

    C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin>mongod --journal --storageEngine=mmapv1 -dbpath c:\data\db
    
If the Windows firewall ask for permission, click the button to "Allow Access".

Now open another Windows Prompt or "Powershell"

To make a connection to MongoDB server that left running in the previous step.

Enter the directory where you installed the binaries again and run:

    c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin\mongo.exe

You will see the prompt mongodb, ready to receive your commands!
___
###Testing and creating Collections or Tables

Enter at the prompt where you run "mongo.exe" run commands below:

    use db 					            <--Create a database called db. If exists it enters in the collection.
    db.createCollection('parametros')	<--Create a collection called parametros
    db.createCollection('log_erro')		<--Create a collection called log_erro
    db.createCollection('indice')		<--Create a collection called indice
    show dbs 				            <--Show names of banks and their sizes
    show collections			        <--Displays the collections in the current bank
    exit					            <--Exit to mongo shell or **Ctrl + C**

Installing the service for MongoDB automatically start on Windows **boot**.

Enter the directory where is installed the binaries and run the command.

    c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin\mongod --config "c:\data\mongod.cfg" --install
    
If your system is Windows 32bits

    c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin\mongod --journal --config "c:\data\mongod.cfg" --install
    
I use as webadmin the "**mongobooster**"

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.
